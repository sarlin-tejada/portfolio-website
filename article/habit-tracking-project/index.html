                <p class="overview-intro">
                    I've spent countless hours every week decoding my calendar, just to figure out where the time went. So I built a habit tracking 
                    pipeline that turns those data blocks into instant metrics‚Äîcompletion rates, blocker trends, and a score illustrating alignment 
                    with my goals and values.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this post, I will be sharing the build (<strong>Google Calendar ‚Üí MongoDB ‚Üí MySQL</strong>), the dashboards (<strong>Tableau</strong>) 
                    it powers, and the lessons I've learned while turning daily life-logs into automated actionable feedback.

                    <h3>üåÑ The Journey</h3>
                    <p class="quote">
                        Life is a series of hills and valleys ‚Äî and if left to its own devices, those patterns can derail
                         our path.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the years, I've become more focused on designing ways to understand and improve my behavior 
                        through life experiences and daily habits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This led me to a personal necessity to plan, track, and reflect on how my time was spent by using my 
                        Google Calendar to structure my day to day life with an agile methodology in mind ‚Äî planning each month 
                        with a core problem to solve, each week with a focused theme, and each day around intentional tasks
                         and supportive rituals.

                    <h3>THE PROBLEM: Manual Reflection Wasn't Sustainable üò£</h3>
                    <p>
                        Weekly check-ins became labor-intensive and inconsistent. I also couldn't shake the feeling that 
                        my calendar could serve as a data source for habit insights on behavioral patterns and make 
                        data-driven decisions.

                    <p>
                        My calendar already tracks everything: daily focus blocks, rituals, habit markers, and tasks 
                        organized by weekly themes and monthly goals. Also, a weekly check-in involving a multi-step 
                        audit that looks like the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Skimming through each day to track what I actually completed</li>
                        <li>Comparing planned activities vs. missed ones</li>
                        <li>Reflecting on what blocked me, or where I lost focus</li>
                        <li>Trying to extract insights that could shape next week's focus and monthly goal alignment</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        But my system only worked when life was stable. If I missed a week or two, the backlog would 
                        grow, and I'd lose visibility into behavioral patterns. I needed a repeatable way to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Extract structured, accurate data from my calendar</li>
                        <li>Automate habit tracking and completion metrics</li>
                        <li>Identify patterns and blockers with minimal effort</li>
                        <li>Support planning with evidence, not memory or visual observation</li>

                    Turning behavior into insight takes more than <strong>collecting data</strong> ‚Äî it requires designing systems that
                    can <strong>clean</strong>, <strong>organize</strong>, <strong>analyze</strong>, and <strong>visualize</strong>

                    <p>
                        The <strong>ETL pipeline</strong> is organized into modular components to follow a clear separation of concerns 
                        so that the system is easier to maintain, scale, and reason with. This separation gives me flexibility during development, 
                        while MySQL serves as the clean, structured destination for analysis and future data visualization.

                        <h4>üß© Design Principles</h4>
                        <p>
                            From the beginning, this project followed an <strong>agile</strong>, <strong>exploratory approach</strong>. I knew I wanted to
                            analyze habit consistency and behavioural patterns, but I didn't want to over-engineer a solution before the end goal was fully clear.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To avoid that trap, I designed the pipeline around three principles:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Staging before structuring</strong> ‚Äì Raw data is first stored in MongoDB to allow inspection, flexibility,
                                and iteration before enforcing structure
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Modularity and maintainability</strong> ‚Äì Each part of the data flow (extraction, transformation, loading) lives in its own service or 
                                repository, making it easier to update or test in isolation
                            </li>
                            <li>

                        Once the calendar data is transformed and stored in MySQL, it serves as the foundation for weekly analysis, 
                        and long-term behavior insights in order to surface trends, track consistency, and uncover blockers ‚Äî all in 
                        service of aligning how time is spent with what matters most.

                            This analysis is guided by a descriptive analysis approach that highlights what actually
                            happened over the week by tracking weekly completion rates, identifying blockers, and enabling time distribution visualization
                            by addressing key questions like the following:

                        <ul>
                            <li>What went well? What didn't? Planned vs. Completed Activities</li>

                        <p>
                            This analysis is guided by a diagnostic analysis approach that supports value alignment,
                            energy optimization, and proactive planning in the weekly plan ahead ritual. It helps 
                            translate data into better decisions for the upcoming week by focusing on uncovering 
                            patterns related to the following:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>What habits showed consistency or fluctuation?</li>
                            <li>Are there recurring friction points or blockers that need attention?</li>
                            <li>Are certain habits more successful at specific times of day or week?</li>
                            <li>Is there a growing gap between stated values and actual behavior?</li>
                            <li>Where can time be reallocated for greater alignment or effectiveness?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            By surfacing long-term behavioral patterns, this step helps ensure each week is informed by
                            the previous one ‚Äî evolving over time with purpose and clarity.

                    <p>
                        While the data analysis and visualization layers aren't complete yet, the system is already
                        surfacing meaningful cues.

                    <p>
                        I've started noticing patterns in focus breakdowns, identified routines that tend to slip, and noticed
                        how certain activities cause a consistent fall-off in rhythm. These early signals are already 
                        helping me adjust with more awareness ‚Äî and once the dashboards are in place, I expect the insights 
                        to run even deeper.
